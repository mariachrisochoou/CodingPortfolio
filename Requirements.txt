DEVELOPING PROCESS:

1. Define the problem: Before you start coding, it is important to understand the problem you are trying to solve with your application. Define the requirements, functionalities, and objectives of your application.
2. Create a design: Based on the requirements, create a design for your application. Decide which technologies, tools, and frameworks you will use, and create a rough architecture of your application.
3. Set up your development environment: Install the necessary tools and software, such as the Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and any third-party libraries and frameworks you will be using.
4. Create a project structure: Organize your code into packages and create a directory structure that will allow you to manage your code effectively.
5. Write code: Start writing code for your application. Follow best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
6. Test your application: Create test cases and unit tests to ensure that your application is working as expected.
7. Debug and refine your application: Debug any issues that arise and refine your code until your application meets the requirements and objectives.
8. Deploy your application: When your application is ready, deploy it to a production environment or a testing environment, depending on your needs.
